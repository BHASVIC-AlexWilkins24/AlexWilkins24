## Hi there!
# About me
I am a 17 year old college student studying Maths, Computer Science and Physics. I'm passionate about software development and learning about innovative technologies and engineering. I am someone who always enjoys learning new things and am always up for a challenge. 

My proffessional goals are to gain strong technical skills in engineering and work in the space technology or AI industry. To gain experience I am on the hunt for interships and work experience in a bid to gain as much experience as possible. My biggest ambition is the start my own tech company. I have always loved business so would be great to be able to bring my two passions together and create really impactful products. 

Currentlly, I'm working on my Computer Science project. For this project I have decided to a develop a plant care app for android devices. This app will contain features such as a log of all your plants, reminders of when to water your plants and a visual garden planner. I have been really looking forward to this project as we follow a very similar structure to how an app would be developed in industry, through the analysis, design, development, testing and evaluation stage. I tried to identify gaps in the market for my app and I feel there is a gap in the market for this kind of app, making it a perfect fit for the project. Currently, I have near enough completed the analysis stage of the project. 

In the past year or so I have completed a number of online courses, such a course in rocket science, particle phyics and linux. I have found these to very interesting and a good way to deepen my knowledge in my subjects. 

In terms of my soft skills, I feel i'm a good communicator and am confident in my ability to lead. I am experienced in working with others and leading groups from the physics competitions I took part in this year, in which I was leading the business department of 8+ members. I am also very good at managing my time and ensure I set priorities when it comes to completing work to the highest possible standard. I have always taken a proactive approach when it comes to my learning, seeking out help if I need it and always have a sense of urgency with this.
